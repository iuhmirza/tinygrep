[Verse 1: wifiskeleton]
I'm not tryna ruin your fun
You're just a little bit late, I guess you're already done
There's this feeling I can't shake 'cause I'm too dumb
I'm never doing the right thing so I'm so stuck
If you see me in America, I might say, "Hi"
But if you meet me out in Europe, I'm a talkative guy
Maybe we'll talk over scones around lunch some time
And I've never been to France so it might be nice
But I can't take this paparazzi, geez
It's like the camera's always out and always starin' at me
And if I say the wrong thing, they'll cut my tongue 'til it bleeds
Always whippin' out their pitchforks when you try to speak
But that couldn't be me

[Verse 2: i wanna be a jack-o-lantern]
Next day I'm walkin' the road
Kickin' rocks, it's my fault
My life's the worst story told
I'll be this way 'til I'm old
I rip a page out the book, I'm just so misunderstood
I always think about her, and when my life felt good
I smoked a cig on the porch
It doesn't help me at all, I'm wonderin', what's it all for?
Is this the girl I adore? And I know I can't afford
Watchin' her walk out the door, so I keep it to myself
And keep my feet on the floor
